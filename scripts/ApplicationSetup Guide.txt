Pre Requsite:
==============

- Your system must have installed Python 3.6.4
- Python executable path should be in your PATH variables

Application Setup
==================

- You already have web app installed on docroot directory, this would be the Application Destination Directory where code are deployed and will be deployed.
- Choose location for Staging code
- Choose location for Deployment logs
- Choose location for Backups (Application and Staging code backups)
- Choose location for temporary files
- create a config file 'static_deploy.properties' and place it in the same directory where stContentDeploy.py' resides
- In static_deploy.properties, create some variables for above locations in each line like below:

	1.	env_app_file 	-> location for file env_app.cfg (should be the same directory where stContentDeploy.py' resides)
	
	2.	staging_folder 	-> Location for code staging. This folder will be used to create further app staging folders like:
			   D:\opt\staging\<Environemnt>\<ApplicationName>  
			   e.g. D:\opt\staging\UAT1\dcp
			   
	3.	backup_folder 	-> location for backups
	
	4.	log_folder 	-> location for deployment logs
	
	5.	temp_folder	-> location for temporary files
	
	6.	DEBUG_MSG -> To show extra messages on screen as well as in log file. 1 for print, 0 for No-print

e.g.
	
	[main_info]
	env_app_file=gui_env_app.cfg
	staging_folder=D:\opt\staging
	backup_folder=D:\opt\staging\backup
	log_folder=D:\opt\staging\logs
	temp_folder=D:\opt\staging\temp1
	DEBUG_MSG=0

- Create 'env_app.cfg' file and and place it in the same directory where stContentDeploy.py' resides 
  Add all applications in  this 'env_app_cfg' file in below format:
  
		Format:	<Environment Name>, <Application Name>, <Application Destination Directory>
  
  Populate the file like below:
  
  Add first line like below:
 	
 	appEnv, appName,  app_Dest_dir 

 then add one line for each application like below:

	e.g. sample env_app.cfg:
	appEnv, appName,  	app_Dest_dir 
	UAT1, 	ps, 		D:\web\roots\MTOWEB-SAE\wwwroot  		
	UAT1, 	uas,		D:\web\roots\MTOWEB-SAE\wwwroot	  		
	UAT1, 	rams,		D:\web\roots\MTOWEB-SAE-SERVICES\wwwroot  	
	PROD, 	bdeW, 		D:\web\Roots\MTOWEB-SAE\wwwroot 		
	PROD, 	dcpW, 		D:\web\Roots\MTOWEB-SAE\wwwroot 	

- After completeing all above setup, put the to-be-deployed package (may be downloaded from Harvest) under application staging directory	

- To start deployment application double click "deployStContent.cmd - Shortcut" ; it will launch the application with menu to proceed for application deployment.
  Please  make sure 'Target' & 'Start in' should be set to proper paths.
  
Main command:

python stContentDeploy_cmd.py UAT1 aris
